# HTM-PyGame-2D-object-recognition

### Install

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run

    python main2.py

This was writen rought and dirty, two things so far should happen
1) you should see the printed map in a normal python array
2) see the display and all the features mapped out



Soon i'll continue with the movement part and then glue HTM properly on top of that
